RockertunityAlert is a Bolt plugin which plays a notification sound whenever a new rockertunity spawns near you. Due to the sound being played via an embedded browser, you need to click on the unmute button that appears in the top left of your game before sounds will play. This is required, as web pages will not play sounds until the user interacts with the page.
